As with every software, there will always be secrets data or info that have to be mamanged properly. For terraform, there are several external tools that can help manage secrets. HashiCorp Vault,AWS Secrets Manager,Google Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault are common tools that help to manage infrastructure secrests in terraform.
