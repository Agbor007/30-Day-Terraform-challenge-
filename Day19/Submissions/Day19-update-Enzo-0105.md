- **Date and Time:** 2024-10-03 18:25 PM

__Identify Use Cases for IaC__
Explain how IaC applies across multiple areas, including database provisioning, compute instances, networking, load balancers, and security policies.

__Introduce and Propose IaC__
Present IaC as a framework for managing infrastructure declaratively through code, enabling automated, repeatable, and version-controlled deployments.

__Outline the Challenges IaC Solves__
Highlight how IaC eliminates configuration drift, reduces human error, accelerates deployments, and ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

__Implementation Strategy and Ensuring Consistency__
Describe IaC implementation using tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Azure ARM templates to enforce configuration as code, automate validations, and standardize deployments.

__Streamlined Provisioning with Minimal Manual Intervention__
Demonstrate how self-service provisioning can be enabled via pre-defined IaC templates, allowing teams to spin up infrastructure without DevOps engineers being directly involved.

__Final Presentation and Adoption__
Emphasize the benefits of IaC—faster deployments, improved governance, reduced downtime—and outline a roadmap for immediate implementation to unlock efficiency gains.
