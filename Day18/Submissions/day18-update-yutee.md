Pure testing with terraform is hard. Considering HCL is not really a programming language. 
Automated tests fundamentally involve:
- Unit tests
- Automated tests
- End-to-end tests

an extern library buildt with Go is usually used to test terraform code to ensure it works as expected. It is called terratest.
