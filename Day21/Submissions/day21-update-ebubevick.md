Today, I successfully completed the task of simulating a workflow for deploying infrastructure code using Terraform Cloud. Notably, I had already gone above myself by tackling this task during Day 20. During that process, I integrated version control with GitHub, explored Terraform Cloud features like secure variables, and documented the workflow in a markdown file. Revisiting the task today gave me the opportunity to refine my approach, ensuring a deeper understanding of deploying infrastructure code efficiently and effectively.
